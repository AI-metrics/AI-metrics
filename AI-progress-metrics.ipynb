    "This pilot project collects problems and metrics/datasets from the AI research literature, and tracks progress on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this [Notebook](https://jupyter.org/#about-notebook) to see how things are progressing in specific subfields or AI/ML as a whole, as a place to report new results you've obtained, as a place to look for problems that might benefit from having new datasets/metrics designed for them, or as a source to build on for data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "At EFF, we're ultimately most interested in how this data can influence our understanding of the likely implications of AI. To begin with, we're [focused on gathering it](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/help-eff-track-progress-ai-and-machine-learning).\n",

    "## Notes on importing data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each `.measure()` call is a data point of a specific algorithm on a specific metric/dataset. Thus one paper will often produce multiple measurements on multiple metrics. It's most important to enter results that were at or near the frontier of best performance on the date they were published. This isn't a strict requirement, though; it's nice to have a sense of the performance of the field, or of algorithms that are otherwise notable even if they aren't the frontier for a sepcific problem.\n",
    "* When multiple revisions of a paper (typically on arXiv) have the same results on some metric, use the date of the first version (the CBTest results in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02245v4) are an example)\n",
    "* When subsequent revisions of a paper improve on the original results ([example](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01549v3)), use the date and scores of the first results, or if each revision is interesting / on the frontier of best performance, include each paper\n",
    "  * We didn't check this carefully for our first ~100 measurement data points :(. In order to denote when we've checked which revision of an arXiv preprint first published a result, cite the specific version (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01549v3 rather than https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01549). That way, we can see which previous entries should be double-checked for this form of inaccuracy.\n",
    "* Where possible, use a clear short name or acronym for each algorithm. The full paper name can go in the `papername` field (and is auto-populated for some papers). When matplotlib 2.1 ships we may be able to get nice [rollovers](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/5754) with metadata like this. Or perhaps we can switch to D3 to get that type of interactivity.\n",
